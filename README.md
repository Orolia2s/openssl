# openssl zig package

This is openssl ported to the Zig Build System.

## Anti-Endorsement

Note: I do not endorse openssl. I think it is a pile of trash. My motivation
for this project is because it is a dependency of CPython, which is a
dependency of the most active YouTube downloader,
[ytdlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).
